Simple discord bot written in python for obfuscating lua files sent by a user in a specific channel (also works in direct messages). 
Useful for securing your lua scripts (work with fivem/roblox etc resources).
<br><br><b>This is a modified version for repl and heroku.</b>
If you are trying to run this from your desktop just use the original source from yunglean4171: https://github.com/yunglean4171/discord-bot-lua-obfuscator<br><br>


In repl start a blank template and import from github.com. https://github.com/jmesfo0/discord-bot-lua-obfuscator <br>
In repl put DISCORD_TOKEN in system environment variables. <br>
In repl shell type the following:
